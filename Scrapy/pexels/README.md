## Scrapy downloading images

- using FilePipelines will return a bigger File(in images size, not in number) Spend more time in requesting. If downloading pause or break, cannot view.
- using imagesPipelines will return a smaller File compare to FilePipelines. (pic size is smaller, but more pic). If downloading pause or break, still can view.
